Having a good list of questions, phrases, or keywords along 
with the answers is important to setting up a good deck of 
flash cards. Setting up a mechanism to hide the answer until 
we try to answer it ourselves is important to the tool.

<br/>
Create a list of questions and answers where the answer for 
each question is hidden until you click a button.
While being able to go through a list of questions is helpful, 
part of the reason flash  cards are effective is because you can 
focus on one at a time as you move through the deck.
<br/>

Update the layout of the list of questions and answers so that 
only a single question and answer pair shows as once. You can 
also present this as a card like a physical flash card.
Once youâ€™ve correctly answered a question on a flash card and 
feel confident about it, you can typically set a card aside.
